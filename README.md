# Resume
Here is my resume below.

Hey, I am SkyOB, I am a developer with over 3 years experience I have worked with many servers and have seen many great results:

EXAMPLES

 Amsbox.minehut.gg I joined when it was averaging only 65 players within a month I became developer it went to 150 players average with a peak of 200 players.

 Weaken.life where the original developer quit and then I took their place, the server had no functionality when I took over then I began developing and my friend @rmcminor was the manager at the time, he helped lead me in the developing, and within 2 weeks we got the server running again with over 120 players average. but a few seasons later, I got demoted for a silly reason and the server went down to a 40 player average.

 Crystal0.minehut.gg went from nothing to something in just 2 days I created the server within 2-3 days and right after it was gaining a lot of intrest by many players producing 70 player average and a lot of purchases within the first week we made many updates and the grow just continued and continued in till I quit minecraft and then we closed it down.

LANGUAGES

 I have a few languages known such as Python, Skript, Javascript, and learning c++ curently
